                    <span class="education-company">This project is a very typical design and application of PWM part. If someone wants to have a deep understanding about this part, I strongly recommend to learn about this project. With the outputting of different frequencies, we can achieve much more than this simple piano. For example, in some certain controlling circuits which require different voltages, we can easily output the required voltages without using of some other circuits. Whatâ€™s more, the fast switching of the outputting voltage can also be simply achieved, which dominates the physical circuits. About the selection of the components, the MPR121 is really a preferrable choice because its sensitivity and durability are very excellent. In the future, I would like to add a microphone to this project, which can be used to input our own voice and change its volume and frequency. Also, I hope some teams can try to achieve this imagination later. Last but not the least, a screen which can show the tones should be considered, about the selection, I strongly recommend the I2C 1602 LCD screen because it is very basic and compatible for our new designer as I learn.</span>
