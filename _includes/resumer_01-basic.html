                <dt class="text-upper">As can be seen, the final project is a simple electronic piano, which is composed with some tone keys, a speaker, two sensors, and an embedded system board. How to play it? Similar to the normal pianos, you can play different tones while kicking different keys. Of course, you can also hold any key to play a continuous sound. What is more, holding two or more keys at the same time is allowed, which is called cord in music. When some keys are touched, the corresponding color will show through the LED on the board. Equally, mixed color will show when the cord happens. Now, let’s see the first two keys from the right side, which can be used to adjust the volume of the piano. When you hold plus, there will be red light. When you hold minus, the blue light will be on. On top of that, the light levels indicate different volume levels. For example, if you keep holding the minus, the blue light will show and gradually become dark. Finally, as you can see, there is a gesture sensor beside the board. This sensor is used to play some loaded music. There are four controlling methods: up, down, right, left. For example, if you slide the hand to right, it will play a music that I saved before. On the other side, another music will be played. Of course, there is also some other functions that you can choose, such as playing the same music in different tones or speed, which you can change easily in the code part.
